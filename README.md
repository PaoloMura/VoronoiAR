# Background

The Voronoi sculpture in the University of Bristol's Fry Building represents a 2D slice of a 3-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. The Voronoi tessellation was envisioned by selecting over 300 points in 3D space. Each point has a 3D region around it (known as its cell), which contains the space that is closer to this point than any other point. The sculpture represents a 2D slice of these 3D cells.

# Task

This repo is a copy of the open source team project I worked on as part of the year 2 Software Engineering Project.

The University of Bristol's School of Mathematics asked us to design an AR app. Its aim was to help users visualise the full 3D tessellation of the Fry Building Sculpture.

# Progress

I acted as the team 'secretary' to communicate with our client. Throughout the project I also worked on the following:
* Performed on-site testing of the AR features
* Manually aligned the model to the sculpture
* Redesigned the UI
* Curated the team's kanban board

# Features

The completed app includes the following features:
* Home screen
* Settings page where admins can manually input the start offsets for the model
* Information page where users can learn about Voronoi patterns, the sculpture and link to other educational sources
* AR page
  * Users can use the controls to manually align a red, virtual sculpture to the real physical one
  * When satisfied with the alignment, the user can then view the full tessellation
  * They can toggle an option to view cubes at the original generating points

# Result

We finished the app before the deadline and deployed to the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=voronoi.augmentedimage&gl=GB).
Our client even began making arrangements to erect a permanent plaque in the courtyard.
It would display a QR code to link to our app and help with model alignment.
I also produced a [video demo](https://youtu.be/2crWSpcB9Eo) of the full features of the app.

Overall I achieved a 70 in this unit.
