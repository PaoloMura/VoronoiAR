# 3DVoronoiRepo
Team 3

The Voronoi sculpture in the University of Bristol's Fry Building represents a 2D slice of a 3-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. The Voronoi tessellation was envisioned by selecting over 300 points in 3D space. Each point has a 3D region around it (known as its cell), which contains the space that is closer to this point than any other point. The sculpture represents a 2D slice of these 3D cells.

This project aims to visualise the original points used to create the pattern by implementing an AR app. The main feature of the app will be to display the points in 3D space within the Fry building while viewing the screen of a user's mobile device. Potential additional features may include visualising the 3D cells themselves and providing educational information within the app or via links to other sources.

The app will be available for use by all visitors to the Fry Building including students, staff and visitors on open days.
