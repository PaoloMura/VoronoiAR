### 2pm Thursday 3rd December

The meeting was between the team members only and focused purely on the MVP:

* Tasks were assigned on GitHub Projects
* Aim to have a partial prototype ready by the following Wednesday to allow adaptation to the Fry Building
* Got hold of blueprints for the building from the client for use in determining relative position within the Fry Building
