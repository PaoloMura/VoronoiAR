Moise, Paolo and Samuel made a plan for moving towards a beta release:

* High priority
  * 3D tessellation model
    * Edges vs cells
    * Useful links
    * Algorithms
    * Voro++
    * It will be confined to a cuboid with height and width equal to that of the sculpture and depth set to encompass the furthest points
  * Refactor skeleton code
    * Strip away unnecessary code
    * Create a modular structure ready to add different screens/features
* Low priority
  * Alignment
    * Can't be done easily without on-site testing (none of the three were in Bristol)
    * Research ARCore's placement/transformation functions to see if there's a more precise way
  * Deployment to Google Play Store
  * Home and information screens
  * Environment-responsive colour changing model
  * Multiple anchors
