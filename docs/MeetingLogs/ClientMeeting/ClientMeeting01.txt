9:30am Tuesday 20th October

The initial meeting was used for introductions between team members and the client. The team also put questions forward in order to better understand the project and required features. A summary of the main points raised follows:

-Clarification on the model
  -the points are all within the Fry Building
  -no more than 3 cells will ever meet at a point
-Future resources
  -client can provide a csv file of the points as well as the coordinates of the frame corners
  -will be granted access to the Fry Building
-Initial research and project direction ideas
  -efficient algorithms for generating the Voronoi pattern
  -could attempt to generate the pattern virtually to check correctness, comparing to the sculpture
  -could start with a wireframe model, then consider 3D objects/multiple 2D slices
-Client is happy for the project to be free, open source
