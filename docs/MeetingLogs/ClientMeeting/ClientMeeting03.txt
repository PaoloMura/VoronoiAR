The meeting involved a brief exchange of progress from both parties:

-Client
  -building access has now been granted
  -a desk will be available as a workstation if notice is provided 24 hours in advance
  -still waiting on architectural plans for the building
  -suggested a potential non-vital feature could be to scan any 2D Voronoi pattern and then generate and render a 3D point structure for it
-Team
  -decided to go with MIT license
  -chose to go down the route of designing a 3D model rather than real-time processing to start with
