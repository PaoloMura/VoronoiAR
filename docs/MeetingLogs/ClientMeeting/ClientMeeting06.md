### 10am Wednesday 16th December

By this meeting, the MVP had been shared with the client.

* MVP
  * Tracking seems to work well
  * 'IF' we run into problems with tracking it could be because there are 5 degrees of freedom used by the devive (3 for position but only 2 for rotation)
    * Consider using the staircase as a larger reference to solve
  * Client looks forward to seeing the full tessellation
* Next Meeting
  * Decided to meet on Tuesday 26th January at 9:30am
