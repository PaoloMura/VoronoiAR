# PERSONAL DATA, PRIVACY, SECURITY AND ETHICS MANAGEMENT


## Personal Data

The application will measure the user’s position within the Fry building using the anchor points from the sculpture, and the use of the camera may show personal information including faces and other potentially private images to the app, however none of this data will be stored, the location and camera will only be used for immediate calculations and to display to the device screen and as such will not be recorded for any reason.


## Privacy and Security

The app will have access to the user’s camera, once permission is given. With applications released for android devices it is impossible to use the camera without the user having given consent. The application will include a statement outlining the fact that any imagery will not be stored or used for any purpose except from the application’s intended purposes. The application will only use the device’s rear camera and as such is unlikely to capture the primary user’s face, and will not include any form of facial recognition anyway.


## Ethics

Despite no current laws prohibiting it, we will have the permission of the university Math Department to incorporate Augmented Reality on their private property and on the sculpture itself, to avoid any ethical dilemma preventing the use of AR in the Fry building. The application will include a statement making it clear to the user that the application uses AR technology and so any images shown though appearing through their devices camera may not accurately portray the environment in front of them. This avoids any incidents of user’s being misled by the application’s display and potentially injuring themselves or others.
This application may also result in some ethical mental problems, for example young children or those suffering from mental health problems may be scared or confused by some features of the application, but this can easily be resolved by implementing an age restriction upon users of the app, and including in the previously mentioned statement a section outlining the fact that the app should only be used by those comfortable with the use of AR above a certain age.
