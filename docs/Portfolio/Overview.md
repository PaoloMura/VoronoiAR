# OVERVIEW

## The Client

The client is the University of Bristol’s School of Mathematics. The School’s Fry Building was recently refurbished and part of this project involved the erection of a large Voronoi pattern sculpture opposite the entrance.

Dr Marton Balazs and Professor Peter Green represent the client. Dr Balazs is the IT-representative within the School and the main point of contact on the project. Professor Green prepared the initial calculations for the Voronoi sculpture and provides his expertise on Voronoi patterns.
												

## Domain

The domain of the project is an educational mobile application, using augmented reality (AR) technology. The app will be developed as an open-source solution and available for download by visitors of the Fry Building.

AR apps have been developed for similar purposes such as in museums to bring an interactive element to their otherwise static or 2-dimensional displays.
												

## Project

The sculpture is a representation of a 2D slice of a 3-dimensional Voronoi tessellation. The tessellation’s structure is mathematically defined by a set of points within the Fry Building.

The project’s aim is to display these points in augmented reality. Ideally the entire 3D tessellation could be viewed. The purpose of the solution is for educational interest of all visitors of the Fry Building. It should therefore be responsive, convenient and user-friendly.
												

## Vision for Project Solution

The solution is intended to be a mobile app that visitors will be able to download when in the atrium or courtyard of the Fry Building.

When the user opens the app, they will see the view from their device’s camera on-screen. The app will detect the sculpture’s position and orientation and display a 3D image of the Voronoi tessellation overlaid on the real view of the sculpture. As the user moves around the space, the 3D image will adjust its position and orientation accordingly.

Potential additional features could include educational links and descriptions as well as a general-purpose Voronoi tessellation generator for any given 2D Voronoi slice.
