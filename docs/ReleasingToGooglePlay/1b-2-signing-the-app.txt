debug signing
  android studio automatically signs the app every time it is run or debugged
  the keystore is located in $HOME/.android/debug.keystore (C:/Users/USERNAME/.android/debug.keystore)
  the details required each time to sign the app are stored in a 'configuration' object by android studio
     the object includes the keystore location, keystore password, key name, and key password
  the debug certificate expires after 30 years
    to reset
