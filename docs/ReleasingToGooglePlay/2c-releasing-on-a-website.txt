releasing on a website
see: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish

this is for if the app is to be hosted on somewhere other than google play
the app can be made available for download on a non- google play website

the process

1) prepare for release
  - see '1a-preparing-for-release.txt'

2) host the 'release-ready' APK on the chosen website and provide a link

the users must have their settings to allow installation of apps from unknown sources
see: https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#unknown-sources (the bottom of the page)

  - to allow installation of apps from non-first-party sources on devices running Android 7.1.1 (API level 25) and lower, they should enable the Unknown sources setting in Settings > Security

downsides to not releasing on Google Play Store
  - no access to the in-app billing service (if the app were to be monetized)
  - no access to the licensing service which prevents unauthorised installation and use of the app (most likely only for monetized apps as well)
